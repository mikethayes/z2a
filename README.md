# z2a

Guess what three words have in common. BUT! The letters of each work are initiall hidden. The letters are revealed in reverse alphabetical order.

e.g.
For Zoe, you would first see
```
_ _ _
```
Next you would see
```
Z _ _
```
Then
```
Z o _
```
And finally
```
Z o e
```

This is based on a mini-game from the BBC TV series House of Games hosted by Richard Osman

## Implemetnation Notes
This first version is pretty basic. It uses tqdm as timer for each letter. It uses ANSI escape sequences for colours and for clearing the screen.
Other than that it's basic python code - my python is rusty so this is a good way to get going again.
